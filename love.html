        <h1>🙃❤️ Well, Congratulations! ❤️🙃</h1>
        <p>You've finished my little game. First off, **Happy Valentine's Day!** 🎉💘</p>
        <p>But... 😅 I highly doubt you'd finish this in one day, so it's probably **not** Valentine's anymore. 🌹</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, **I love you.** And I love your **boobs** 🙂❤️🙂</p>
        <p>🥲 I miss boobs... poor me.</p>
        <p>Anyway, just so you know, **I'm taller than you** 🫴😉</p>
        <p>Ohh yeah, **I went to the beach today.** 🤭🙂</p>
        <p>By the time you're reading this, it'll probably be a few days ago, if not **weeks or even a month.** 🫢</p>
        
        <h2>🌊 My Almost-Dying Story 😹</h2>
        <p>So, **I almost died twice** at the beach.</p>
        <p>The first time, we were feeling **confident** (or maybe it was just **our manhood** telling us we couldn’t be scared of the ocean), so we went in **a bit deep**.</p>
        <p>Then came a **slightly bigger wave** 🙂‍↔️. It **smacked me HARD** and **forcefully submerged me.**</p>
        <p>My lungs were screaming **"Breathe! Breathe!"** but my eyes were closed, I was completely off balance, and I had no sense of direction.</p>
        <p>Then my brain said, **"Open your eyes!"** 🥲 Bad idea. **I got sand in them.** 😹</p>
        <p>Now I was **blind, drowning, and breathless.**</p>
        <p>But luckily, when the wave pulled back, the water level **dropped from chest-deep to knee-deep** for a moment.</p>
        <p>So, I escaped. But my eyes were **burning**, and I suffered for like **8 minutes** before I could open them again.</p>
        <p>After that? **I sat down, got dry, and went home.** 🙂‍↔️</p>

        <h2>💖 The Moral of the Story?</h2>
        <p class="peace">I'll always love you. 💌✌️ Peace.</p>
